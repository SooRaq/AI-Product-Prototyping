Building an Air Quality Prediction App

Factors affecting Air Quality:

PM2.5 and PM10: Particulate matter

NO, NO2, NOx: Nitrogen oxides

NH3: Ammonia

CO: Carbon monoxide

SO2: Sulfur dioxide

O3: Ozone

Benzene, Toluene, Xylene: Volatile organic compounds

The primary goal of this air quality prediction model is to accurately forecast the Air Quality Index (AQI).
